# Article I - Statement of Principles and Goals 


## §1 Absolute Principles



1. Every human deserves the same rights, regardless of status, gender, race, national origin, ethnicity.
2. The government exists to preserve and protect the rights of the people.

5. No law may be overly broad or be designed to cover more actions than necessary to fulfill its goal.
6. No infringement that cannot be justified may stand.
7. Every one having stake in any legislation shall have the right to raise, and have addressed as necessary after a careful weighing, reasonable concerns, and such right shall not be even with respect to financial ability or inability

15. Medical care, including:
    1. Basic care.
    2. Urgent care. 
    3. Dentalcare.

17. A good education, including universal access to universities, colleges, apprenticeships, and trade schools.
18. Housing, both generally and in affordability.
19. Safe and regulated structures that ensure trust and reliability.
20. Equal rights and protection on the basis of:
    9. Race.
    10. Colour.
    11. Religion or creed.
    12. National origin or ancestry.
    13. Sex, including:
        1. Gender.
        2. Pregnancy.
        3. Sexual orientation.
        4. Gender identity.
    14. Age.
    15. Veteran status.
    16. Citizenship.
    17. Genetic information.
    18. Physical and/or mental disability.
21. Freedom of speech, expression, assembly, religion, and a free press. Any infringements, whether cracking down on protests, banning books, and online censorship shall be impermissible.
22. Collective bargaining. Anti-competitive, anti-trust, and ‘union-busting’ tactics shall be impermissible.
23. Democratic representation in every chamber of government. This includes the senate and may be extended towards the monarchy when the time comes.
24. Clean and safe drinking water, food, air, drugs, and environment
25. Walkable living spaces and public transportation.
26. Emergency services such as police, fire, rescue, and towing.
27. Protections from abuses, including in the workplace, at a school, and at home.
28. Protections from antitrust, anti-competitive, and monopolistic practices.
29. Protection from the taking of private property or services for public use without just compensation.
30. Free and Fair Elections, and public trust in Elections.

In particular, we believe that it is absolutely impermissible for a law without due justification to infringe on these rights at all, and that the Government should do what it can to positively guarantee these rights, provided that it does not unduly infringe upon the rights of another individual.
