# Article IV - Candidates, Electoral District Associations, and Relevant Provincial Parties


## §1 Unrepresented Electoral Districts

Any Electoral District not presently represented by an Electoral District Association of the Party may have the candidate appointed by the Party prior to any General Election, and the members of the party who ordinarily reside in that district for electoral purposes shall have the option to object. 

If either 100 members of the party, or ⅓ of the members of the party, who ordinarily reside in that district for electoral purposes objects, then all such members shall be able to vote on any candidate which is nominated by such a member or by the Party Leader, or may request the formation of an Electoral District Association in accordance with §13 instead. 


## §2 Electoral District Associations

In any Electoral District where at least 100 members of the party, or ⅕ of the members of the party, whichever is lesser, resides for electoral purposes, either 50 of those members, or ½, whichever is lesser, may submit a request for the Executive Council to Establish an Electoral District Association in that District. The Request shall include a Constitution, Charter, or By-laws for the Association and shall indicate the date in which an election will be held to elect at least a President, but other Executives and/or officers of the Electoral District Association may be elected at the same time. The Request shall not be unreasonably denied by the Executive Council and is set forth in a by-law that includes the Constitution, Charter, or By-laws submitted in the request, but such may be amended in accordance with that document. Electoral District Associations elect in accordance with their own Constitution, Charter, and/or By-laws, the candidate sponsored by the Party in that District.

If at any time an Electoral District Association fails to meet the Membership requirement, or acts in breach of this Charter, any By-laws passed by the Executive Council, or its own Charter, Constitution, and/or By-laws, the Executive Council may dissolve the Electoral District Association by a simple majority.


## §3 Relevant Provincial Parties

Any Provincial Party which has aligned goals and principles with this party may have its President make an application to the Executive Council to be recognized as a Relevant Provincial Party. The application shall include the Constitution, Charter, or By-laws of the Party, which shall be consistent with this Charter and By-laws adopted by the Executive Council, and which may be amended in accordance with that document. If the Executive Council agrees the party has aligned goals and principles, it may recognize the Provincial Party to be Relevant. At most one such Party may be recognized per province. Any recognition may be revoked by the Executive Council.

While Recognized, a Relevant Provincial Party shall abide by its own Constitution, Charter, and/or By-laws, as well as this Charter and any By-laws passed by the Executive Council, but this charter and such By-laws shall be supreme, anything in the Provincial Party's By-laws notwithstanding.

A Relevant Provincial Party's Primary Executives, being the President, Party Leader, and Chief Agent, shall be Executives of this party, and shall sit on the Executive Council, but the Chief Agent shall sit as an Ex Officio Member
