# Article II - Membership and Executive authority

## §1 Membership

The party shall consist of members, who shall be admitted on Reasonable and Non-discriminatory grounds set by the Executive Council. A reasonable fee may be required, in an amount set by the Executive Council and collected by the Chief Agent, but any person who is unable to pay the fee may submit a request in writing to the President, which shall not be unreasonably denied. 

Any fee collected shall be annual or one time, and shall not exceed $30 for an annual fee, or $70 for a one time fee. Any one who is admitted to the party on the basis of paying a duly set one time fee shall not be required to pay an annual fee for continuance of membership, but may be required to submit a notice of intent to continue membership on an annual basis, and upon failure to keep continued membership, may be required to pay the one time fee again or begin paying annual fees.

No executive shall be exempted from paying party membership fees by way of their position.


## §2 Primary Executives

There shall be 3 primary executives, being the President, Party Leader, and Chief Agent. These shall be chosen by the Members on a regular basis, in accordance with this Charter. They shall have the duties and authorities prescribed by this Charter.

The Primary Executives shall hold no other Executive Position in the party, nor of any Electoral District Association of the party, nor of any Related Provincial Party, except that they may be Candidate sponsored by the Electoral District Association in which they reside, and the Party Leader shall be a Candidate sponsored by either an Electoral District Association, or the party in an unrepresented Electoral District. 

The President of the Party shall be responsible for the administration of the party, chairing the Executive Council and all General Meetings and shall be the co-signing Executive for expenses related to administration or management.

The Party Leader shall be responsible for political matters of the party, including Managing Candidates and Caucus Members, making deals for Coalitions and other support agreements, setting the specific direction of the party within the General Direction set in Policy of the Executive Council and herein, and for any campaigning by the party, and shall be co-signing Executive on all expenses related to campaigning and candidacy.

The Chief Agent shall be responsible for the financial matters of the party. Additionally, the Chief Agent may enter into agreements and contracts in writing on behalf of the party, but at least one other Primary Executive must also co-sign.

Each Primary Executive shall be a Member and shall be at least 18 years of age. 

### §3 Additional Executives

From time to time, the President and Party Leader may, by request of relevant portions of the party membership, establish additional Executive Positions, which are voted on by relevant portions of the party membership.

These Additional Executives include: 


* Primary Executives (President, Party Leader, and/or Chief Agent) of Provincial parties related to the Party
* President of Electoral District Associations in Electoral Districts that sponsor a Candidate of the Party for Federal General Elections. 
* Secretary of the Party
* Members at Large

Any person who holds an additional Executive position shall hold no other additional Executive Position, and, in the case of a Provincial Party Executive or the president of an Electoral District Association shall reside, for electoral purposes, in the province or district the association applies.

There may be as many Members at Large as the President of the party sees fit to allow, but at a minimum, there shall be 5 positions or 1 for every 100 party members, whichever is greater, whether or not all minimum positions are filled.


### §4 Executive Council

The Primary Executives and additional Executives shall collectively form a Council for decision making in the party. Quorum for a meeting thereof shall be one half of the Executives, excluding the Members at Large, and these meetings shall occur at least once monthly, on a date and time that the President may declare.

Unless otherwise dictated by the President or the Executive Council, the President shall preside over each meeting.

At least once per year, rather than an Executive Council Meeting, the party shall hold a General Membership meeting, but otherwise members shall always be privileged to attend an Executive Council meeting provided they are not removed by the Executive Council, but non-executives shall have no authority to vote before an Executive Council Meeting.

A member at large may be expelled by a simple majority vote, but any other executive only by 2/3s. A simple majority vote may also refer the President or Party Leader to a Special General Meeting which then considers the confidence of the party membership in the President or Party Leader, and such a meeting or any General Meeting may remove that executive by ½. 

Primary Executives of Related Provincial Parties may be removed by the Provincial party in accordance with rules in the constitution, charter, or by-laws thereof, which shall contain such rules. The President of a Electoral District Association may be removed by the Electoral District Association in accordance with rules in the constitution, charter, or by-laws thereof, which shall contain such rules. A simple majority vote of the Executive Council may refer a Primary Executive of a Related Provincial Party or the President of an Electoral District Association to that Related Provincial Party or Electoral District Association as the case may be for consideration of removal in accordance with such rules. 

The Executive Council may make By-laws allowed by this Charter, and policies for the application thereof. The Executive Council may further establish Committees of the Executive Council which can make and enact policies, in accordance with its establishing by-laws, and this Charter.

The Chief Agent shall be an Ex Officio Member of the Executive Council, but shall not have a vote on any matter, other than in matters regarding the finances of the party.
